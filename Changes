HISTORY - public release history for MLDBM

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=over 8

=item 2.01  (07 July 2002)

New testing method MLDBM::_compare($a, $b) used in t/*.t
scripts to verify data structures are identical.  In 
perl 5.8.0 RC2, the order of hashes changed, making the prior
hard coded test case string comparisons invalid, so created
this more flexible method for testing that should work in 
future releases, without relying on specific hash ordering.

=item 2.00  (10 May 1998)

Added support for multiple serializing interfaces. (courtesy
Raphael Manfredi <Raphael_Manfredi@grenoble.hp.com>)

Split serializer wrappers into multiple files, and regularized
the interface some.  Underlying TIEHASH object and serializer
can now be set at runtime (with care).

Miscellaneous pod tweaks.
