This is the README file for MLDBM, the Perl module that can 
be used to store multidimensional hash structures in DBM files.

It requires:
   Perl Version 5.003 or later.
   The Data::Dumper package from CPAN, version 2.07 or later.

Please note that this version supercedes the version that
comes as an example with the Data::Dumper distribution.

If you were able to install Data::Dumper with its XSUB 
extension, MLDBM will perform significantly faster.

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

As always, feedback is very welcome.

-----------

Installation:

You must install the Data::Dumper package first.

From the MLDBM source directory:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make test
   make install

is all that will be needed.  If you run into problems due to
old MakeMaker, or if you cannot run MakeMaker because it is
not supported on your platform, simply copy the MLDBM.pm file
over into your PERL5LIB directory and you'll be okay.
