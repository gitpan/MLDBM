This is the README file for MLDBM, the Perl module that can 
be used to store multidimensional hash structures in tied hashes
(including DBM files).

This is version 1.25.  It requires:
   Perl Version 5.004 or later.
   The Data::Dumper package from CPAN, version 2.08 or later.

Please note that this version supercedes the version that
comes as an example with the Data::Dumper distribution.

If you were able to install Data::Dumper with its XSUB 
extension, MLDBM will perform significantly faster.

See the embedded documentation in the module for more details.

As always, feedback is very welcome.
